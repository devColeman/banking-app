<!-- 1. Purpose
The application will simulate basic banking operations, allowing users to manage their accounts, perform transactions, and check account details. It will demonstrate encapsulation for data security and abstraction to hide implementation details.

2. Classes and Abstraction
Base Class: Account
This class defines the blueprint for all account types.

Attributes:
accountNumber
accountHolderName
balance

Abstract Methods (Interface):
deposit(amount)
withdraw(amount)
getBalance()

Derived Classes
SavingsAccount
Adds interest (e.g., addInterest(rate)).
Restricts withdrawal to avoid a zero balance.
CheckingAccount
Allows overdraft up to a certain limit.
May have a transaction fee for withdrawals.

3. Key Features (User Interactions)
Core Operations
Deposit Money
User specifies account and amount.
Adds the amount to the balance.
Withdraw Money
User specifies account and amount.
Validates if the amount can be withdrawn (e.g., savings cannot go below zero, overdraft limit in checking).
Transfer Money
Moves money between two accounts, ensuring all validations are respected.
View Account Details
Displays account holder name, account number, and current balance.

4. Abstraction in Action
The user interface only calls high-level methods like deposit(), withdraw(), or transferFunds().
The base class Account provides the abstract definition of these methods.
The specific logic (e.g., overdraft rules or interest calculations) is implemented in the derived classes (SavingsAccount, CheckingAccount).

5. Encapsulation
Sensitive data (e.g., balance, accountNumber) is private or protected.
Getter and setter methods control access and ensure validation (e.g., no withdrawals beyond balance or overdraft limits).

6. Example Usage
Workflow
A user logs in and sees a menu:
"1. Deposit"
"2. Withdraw"
"3. Transfer Funds"
"4. View Account Details"
The user selects an option, and the program calls the corresponding method on the appropriate account object.
Encapsulated and abstracted logic handles the internal processes, ensuring data consistency and security.

7. Optional Add-Ons
Multiple Users: Extend it to support multiple users with unique accounts.
Transaction History: Keep a log of deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
Interest Calculation: Automatically apply interest periodically for savings accounts.
